The human brain responds to music in different ways, depending on the listeners emotional reaction, among other things. Now researchers report that the same holds true for birds listening to birdsong.

The same regions that respond to music in humans, at least the areas that can also be found in the bird brain, responded to song in our sparrows, said an author of the new report, Donna Maney, a neuroscientist at Emory University.

Primed with estrogen to simulate their state during breeding, female white-throated sparrows responded to the songs of male sparrows in the same way as humans listening to pleasant music, she said. Females in a nonbreeding state responded no differently to birdsong than to generic tones of the same frequencies.

So during breeding season, birdsong is received differently by females, Dr. Maney said.

Moreover, male birds treated with testosterone showed a response in the amygdala, the brains emotional center, when they heard other males singing.

The response is akin to the reaction humans have when they hear the sort of music used in a scary movie scene. If youre a male and you hear the song, it means that youre invading territory or being invaded, Dr. Maney said. Its an aggressive signal.

She and her co-author, Sarah Earp, report their findings in the journal Frontiers in Evolutionary Neuroscience. Ms. Earp came up with the idea for the study as an Emory undergraduate studying music and neuroscience. She is a medical student at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine.
