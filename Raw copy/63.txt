Danilo Gallinari led six Denver players in double figures with 17 points, and the host Nuggets stopped the Los Angeles Clippers  franchise-record winning streak at 17 games with a 92-78 victory on Tuesday night.

The Clippers streak was the longest in the N.B.A. since the Boston Celtics won 19 in a row from Nov. 15 to Dec. 23, 2008.

The Nuggets have won eight straight at home.

The Clippers, whose point total was two above their season low, were hurt by poor shooting from 3-point range (5 of 29) and the free-throw line (13 of 29).

Andre Miller, starting in place of point guard Ty Lawson, had 12 points and 12 assists for the Nuggets. Lawson, the team said, has been bothered by tightness in his left Achilles tendon for the past week, forcing him to miss a game for the first time this season.

Forward Andre Iguodala also helped out at point guard with 12 points and 8 assists for Denver.

MAVERICKS 103, WIZARDS 94 A strong second-half performance helped visiting Dallas avoid its first seven-game skid in nearly 14 years.

Vince Carter scored 23 points, and O. J. Mayo and Darren Collison each added 15 for the Mavericks.

Its been a rough two weeks, Mavericks Coach Rick Carlisle said.

Dirk Nowitzki, in his fifth game after coming back from right knee surgery, scored 11 points.

Nowitzki said: The locker room is miserable. The coaches are miserable when we lose, so it definitely is one we wanted to get.

Carter, making only his second start of the season, began the game with a dunk and secured the win with another dunk with 1:11 to play to make it 101-93.

PISTONS 103, KINGS 97 Greg Monroe had 18 points and 11 rebounds, and host Detroit held off Sacramento for its first three-game winning streak of the season. The Kings cut a 16-point, fourth-quarter deficit to one, and Detroit led, 100-97, when Austin Daye made a 3-pointer for the Pistons with 11.5 seconds left. DeMarcus Cousins had 21 points and 14 rebounds for the Kings.

HAWKS 95, HORNETS 86 Josh Smith scored 10 of his 23 points in the third quarter to lead Atlanta to a victory over host New Orleans. Al Horford added 20 points, Kyle Korver 14 and Zaza Pachulia 12 for the Hawks. Hornets guard Eric Gordon, playing in his first home game this season after recovering from a knee injury, scored 11 points. Ryan Anderson scored 23 points for the Hornets.
