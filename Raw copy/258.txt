ARLINGTON, Tex. (AP)  The Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel ran for two touchdowns, threw for two more and piled up a Cotton Bowl-record 516 total yards as 10th-ranked Texas A&M wrapped up its first SEC season with a 41-13 win over No. 12 Oklahoma on Friday night.

The Aggies (11-2) never trailed after Manziel tiptoed the sideline for a 23-yard touchdown run on their opening drive.

After leading by only a point at the half, Texas A&M took control with touchdowns on its first three drives in the third quarter, going ahead by 34-13 when Manziel threw a 33-yard scoring pass to Ryan Swope on fourth-and-4.

Oklahoma (10-3), which like the Aggies entered the game with a five-game winning streak, went three-and-out on its first three drives after halftime.

Manziel set a Football Bowl Subdivision bowl record with his 229 yards rushing on 17 carries, and completed 22 of 34 passes for 287 yards.

He joined Auburns Cam Newton, Floridas Tim Tebow and Nevadas Colin Kaepernick as the only F.B.S. quarterbacks with 20 touchdowns rushing and 20 passing in a season.

Oklahoma, led by quarterback Landry Jones in his 50th career start, had only 312 total yards as a team.
