DILI, East Timor (AP)  The United Nations ended its peacekeeping mission in East Timor on Monday, leaving the country without any direct security assistance for the first time since a spasm of political and ethnic violence in 2006 almost overwhelmed its shaky, post-independence government.

In recent weeks, the remainders of a force of 1,600 police and military officers from countries around the world have been leaving East Timor before the formal end of the deployment, which is a significant milestone in the countrys journey after its independence from Indonesia in 1999.

The United Nations directly administered the country until 2002, when it formally became a nation. A security mission established to help East Timors barely existing state and security institutions ended in 2005. But the violence and political turmoil in 2006, which included an assassination attempt on the president, led to a new peacekeeping presence.

Much of the United Nations work has been focused on training the countrys own police force and army, and security conditions have improved.

The United Nations and other foreign development organizations will remain in the country to support its development for years to come. East Timor has oil and gas reserves, but those resources are not creating the employment opportunities needed for a country of 1.1 million people, many of them under 18.
