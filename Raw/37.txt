For many actors rehearsal is a place to make mistakes. For Glenn Fitzgerald its a place to make art. Starting in 1998, when he took portraits of Nathan Lane and other cast members in Jon Robin Baitzs Mizlansky/Zilinsky, or Schmucks, Mr. Fitzgerald has captured scenes of productions in which hes appeared.

Shot from the seats and backstage, mostly during rehearsals, his work candidly depicts actors awaiting cues, playwrights scrutinizing run-throughs and directors lounging on sets. Sometimes he turns the camera on himself.

In Mr. Fitzgeralds mood-altering snapshots of found moments, the productions are almost unrecognizable. Theyre not necessarily scenes from the play, said Mr. Fitzgerald, who also documents his film and television projects. They are my interpretive moments of where an actor and a character mix.

The New York Times asked Mr. Fitzgerald to choose some of his favorite pictures from two 2012 shows he starred in, Chekhovs Ivanov and Will Enos Realistic Joneses. His photographs tell stories that are different from those of the plays.

Ivanov, about unfulfilled lives in 19th-century Russia, comes across as a 17th-century Dutch pastoral, as if painted by Vermeer. The Realistic Joneses, a dark comedy about illness in the suburbs, looks like a psycho-glam horror film from the lens of David Lynch or Brian De Palma.

Here he describes how the photos came to be. In this audio feature Mr. Fitzgerald narrates a look at two other images.
